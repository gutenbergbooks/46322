 [Illustration: A WISE WARNING]

 Dædalus Bismarck (_Political Parent of_ Wilhelm Icarus).

    "My son, observe the middle path to fly,
    And fear to sink too low, or rise too high.
    Here the sun melts, there vapours damp your force,
    Between the two extremes direct your course.

    "Nor on the bear, nor on boötes gaze,
    Nor on sword-arm'd orion's dangerous rays:
    But follow me, thy guide, with watchful sight,
    And, as I steer, direct thy cautious Flight."
